                            <div class="flex-display">
                                <p><a href="https://21stcr.org/one-god-over-all-history/john-biddle-1615-1662/"
                                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Biddle</a> (1615-1662), was a distinguished
                                    British academic,
                                    graduate of Oxford, and at the age of 26 elected headmaster of Crypt Grammar School
                                    in Gloucester, England.
                                    As he was tasked with teaching Scripture, he thoroughly studied the Bible
                                    and adopted a Unitarian view of God, despite no exposure to Unitarian publications.
                                    This belief led to <em>six imprisonments in his lifetime</em> due to his teachings
                                    and writings
                                    against the concept of the Trinity.
                                    Parliament eventually made denial of the doctrine of the Trinity
                                    a capital offence in 1648.
                                    Biddle, however, escaped the death sentence because in 1655 Lord Protector Oliver
                                    Cromwell banished him to the Scilly Isles.
                                    Released in 1658, he presided over a small group of disciples who met regularly in
                                    London.
                                    Subsequently, he was sent to prison in Newgate in 1662 and died there in September
                                    that year, aged 47. <br>Biddle became known as the <em>'father of English
                                        Unitarianism.'</em>
                                    Here is a sample of his teaching :-<br>
                                    <em>John 17:3. "This is eternal life, that they know thee (Father) the only true
                                        God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent." Observe here in the first place,
                                        that our Saviour Christ, setting down those persons, in whom eternal life
                                        consists,
                                        makes no mention of the Holy Spirit; whereas,
                                        if he were [the one] God, the knowledge of him would be as necessary
                                        for the attainment of eternal life as that of the Father.
                                        Secondly, he so describeth the Father, as that he makes him the only true God,
                                        thereby manifestly excluding any other person whatsoever from being the true
                                        God.</em>

                                    Thomas Emlyn (1663-1741) was a beloved minister
                                    in a Presbyterian church in Dublin, Ireland.
                                    After investigating some recent controversies about "the Trinity,"
                                    Emlyn found himself seeing the New Testament in a unitarian light.
                                    Emlyn was the first preacher who described himself as a unitarian.
                                    Among his many writings, in 1702,
                                    he published <em>An Humble Inquiry into the Scripture-Account of Jesus Christ:
                                        A Short Argument concerning His Deity and Glory, according to the Gospel.</em>
                                    This book which led to Emlyn's conviction and imprisonment by the English government
                                    for blasphemy, is a succinct and erudite argument for the subordination of Jesus
                                    Christ to God the Father.

                            <div class="flex-display">
                                <p><a href="https://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/THEM00008"
                                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sir Isaac Newton FRS</a> (25 December 1642 - 20
                                    March 1727)
                                    was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian,
                                    and author.
                                    After Newton's death, it was discovered that he wrote about theology
                                    more than he did about his scientific works.
                                    That is, he wrote about 1.3 million words on biblical subjects.
                                    In the twentieth century, encrypted manuscripts written by Newton
                                    and bought by John Maynard Keynes (among others) were deciphered
                                    and it became known that Newton did indeed reject Trinitarianism.
                                    <br>Therefore, from his private writings, it is clear that for Newton,
                                    <em>the "supreme" God is the Father alone.</em>
                                    <br>To quote Newton's <em>Twelve articles on religion
                                        :--
                                        <br>1) There is one God the Father everliving, omnipresent, omniscient,
                                        almighty,
                                        the maker of heaven & earth, <br>& one Mediator between God & Man the Man Christ
                                        Jesus.
                                        <br>3) The Father hath life in himself & hath given the son to have life in
                                        himself.
                                        <br>6) All the worship (whether of prayer praise or thanks-giving) which was due
                                        to the father
                                        before the coming of Christ is still due to him.
                                        Christ came not to diminish the worship of his father.
                                        <br>12) To us there is but one God the father of whom are all things & we of
                                        him,
                                        <br>& one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things & we by him.
                                        <br>That is, we are to worship the father alone as God Almighty &
                                        <br>Jesus alone as the Lord the Messiah the great King the Lamb of God who was
                                        slain
                                        & hath redeemed us with his blood & made us kings & Priests.</em>

                                        rel="noopener">Theophilus Lindsey</a> (20 June 1723 - 3 November 1808)
                                    was an English theologian and clergyman who founded
                                    <em>the first avowedly Unitarian congregation in England</em>,
                                    at Essex Street Chapel, London.<br>After learned, calm and diligent inquiries in
                                    Scripture
                                    regarding the warrant for Trinitarian worship; he says, "the more I searched the
                                    more I saw
                                    <em>the little foundation there was for the doctrine commonly received</em>"
                                    (that is, the doctrine of the Trinity) ... "For, in the end, I became fully
                                    persuaded, to use
                                    Paul's express words, <br>1 Corinthians 8:6 <em>'That there is but one God, the
                                        Father,'
                                        and he alone to be worshipped.</em> This appeared to be the uniform, unvaried
                                    language
                                    and practice of the Bible throughout."
                                    <br>Subsequently, Lindsey intended to open a chapel upon <em>principles strictly
                                        Unitarian.</em>
                                    <br>On Sunday, April 17, 1774, the chapel was opened.
                                    Thus in London, Essex Street Chapel, also known as Essex Church,
                                    was the first church in England set up for <em>Unitarian worship and doctrine</em>,
                                    and was established when Dissenters still faced legal threat.

                                    was a leading independent British politician
                                    who held strong dissenting Christian convictions - <em>he was a Unitarian</em>,
                                    and was thus prevented from attaining the Great Offices of State.
                                    He was a member of the Essex Street Chapel.
                                    <br>In 1813 Smith challenged the established church, and was responsible

                                    and granted toleration for Unitarian worship.

                            <div class="flex-display">
                                <p>Dr. William Ellery Channing (1780-1842) has been called <em>"the apostle of
                                        unitarianism."</em>
                                    It was not until 1812 that the Unitarian controversy first rose into importance in
                                    America.
                                    It began among the Congregationalists of Boston and it presently fixed the name of
                                    Unitarians upon a large body of people all over the country. A series of attacks
                                    made upon the ten Congregationalist churches in Boston in the periodical papers of
                                    the day called into being a magazine to promote Unitarianism. This magazine, <em>the
                                        first Unitarian paper
                                        in America, was "The Christian Disciple,"</em> started in 1812. In its pages
                                    Channing and
                                    several other able writers set forth their Unitarian opinions.
                                    <br>At the ordination service for Jared Sparks in Baltimore, Maryland in 1819;
                                    Channing
                                    presented his famous sermon, <em>"Unitarian Christianity."</em> In it, Channing
                                    explains
                                    what unitarian Christians think the Bible teaches about
                                    <em>the one God and his unique Son.</em> He argues both from what the Bible says
                                    and from what it doesn't say. Please listen to the following podcast which presents

                            <div class="flex-display">
                                <p>Francis Maseres (15 December 1731 - 19 May 1824)
                                    was an English lawyer. He is known as attorney general of the Province of Quebec,
                                    judge, mathematician, historian, member of the Royal Society,
                                    and cursitor baron of the exchequer. Maseres describes his belief as follows:<br>
                                    "My creed is derived from my Saviour,
                                    and the time when and the manner in which it was uttered give it a title to
                                    pre-eminence.
                                    A few hours before his death, in an address to his Father, Christ says :--<br>
                                    <em>'This is eternal life, to know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ,
                                        whom Thou hast sent.'</em>
                                    <br>This is my creed, and happy would it be for the Christian world if it had been
                                    content with it, and never laid down any other articles for a common faith."
                                    <br>The following lines, which condense the whole Trinitarian controversy, have been
                                    attributed to him :--<br>
                                    <strong>"Talk of essence, and substance, and no one knows what!<br>
                                        God either made Jesus, or else he did not:<br>
                                        If made, he's a creature, without more ado;<br>
                                        If not, he's God -- and then we have <em>Two.</em>"</strong>

                                    early member of the faculty of Harvard Divinity School,

                                <p>In 1876, Robert Spears (September 25, 1825-February 25, 1899),
                                    published his book, <em>Record of Unitarian Worthies</em>.
                                    This book served as my primary source material for the individuals referenced in
                                    this
                                    timeline, from 1326 to 1824 inclusive.
                                    <br>Spears, a remarkably able and successful Unitarian minister,
                                    was the voice of <em>Biblically-based British Unitarianism in his day.</em>
                                    He organised or reinvigorated twelve congregations and founded journals
                                    and social service organisations. Because of his great energy he has been called
                                    <em>the Unitarian dynamo of the 19th century.</em>
                                    Amongst the majority of those who knew something of Unitarianism in Britain, he was
                                    taken to be the representative figure.
                                    Biblically-based Unitarians saw in him a new champion,
                                    one who would proclaim their beliefs from the housetops. Despite his lack of formal
                                    ministerial training,
                                    in 1861 Spears became minister to a tiny congregation at Stamford Street Chapel in
                                    South London.
                                    He steered the same course as before, making <em>'open profession, exposition, and
                                        defence of Unitarianism.'</em>
                                    In seven years the chapel grew to be one of the largest Unitarian congregations in
                                    London.<br>He boasted,
                                    <em>'There was no dilly dallying about the name Unitarian.'</em>

                                    the existence of laws in multiple nations, persecution, and the fear of death;
                                    the biblical truth about the one God and His human son continues to advance.

                                    readily accessible.

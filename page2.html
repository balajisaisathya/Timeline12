                                <p>Adam Duff was a Unitarian (Anti-Trinitarian) martyr of the fourteenth century.
                                    He denied the Incarnation and the Trinity of Persons;
                                    he was therefore said to be possessed with a diabolical spirit.
                                    He was tried and sentenced to be <em>"burned and hanged in the fire
                                        at Hoggin-green,"</em> near Dublin. The sentence was carried out.

                                        rel="noopener">Ludwig Haetzer</a> (AKA Louis Haetzer) was beheaded on the charge
                                    of blasphemy.
                                    Haetzer, a Swiss, was all intents and purposes, alone in his thought about
                                    the true nature of God <em>"that the Father alone is the true God -
                                        that Christ is not equal to the Father - that there are not three persons in one
                                        God, because God is altogether ineffable, being neither person nor
                                        essence."</em><br>
                                    A man of great learning, he wrote a treatise against the deity of Christ,
                                    but it was soon suppressed. Haetzer was also a composer of many hymns.
                                    There survives the following explicitly anti-Trinitarian utterance,
                                    placed in the mouth of God:<br>
                                    <strong>I am He who created all things through His own might.
                                        Thou askest, how many persons am I?
                                        I am one!<br>
                                        I am not three persons, but I am one!
                                        And I cannot be three persons, but I am one!<br>
                                        I know nothing of persons: I alone am the source of all life.
                                        Him who does not know me, I know not;<br>

                                    An old lady of over eighty years of age. She was burnt in the city of Cracow in
                                    1539.
                                    Before her judges she avowed her view of God in the following language:<br>
                                    <em>"I believe in the existence of One God, who has created all the visible and
                                        invisible world, and who cannot be conceived by the human intellect."</em>
                                    She also denied that Jesus Christ was <em>from eternity</em> the Son of God.
                                    In other words, Jesus the Son of God began his existence in the womb of his mother
                                    <br>(as recorded in Luke 1:30-37) and not before!

                                    was excommunicated from the Anabaptists of Frisia. Why?
                                    On account of his sentiments concerning the Trinity.
                                    <em>He maintained that the Father alone was the true God.</em>
                                    In 1547 whilst in fellowship with the Mennonites, he declared himself a unitarian,
                                    <em>holding that Christ did not exist as the Son of God before his conception.</em>
                                    He was subsequently excommunicated from this community because of his views of God
                                    and Jesus.

                                    during the first half of the sixteenth century.
                                    On his arrival in London he joined the Stranger Church in Austin Friars (pictured).
                                    It is thought he settled in London from having heard "that strangers in England were
                                    exempted from
                                    certain penal laws." This he soon learned was not so, for having declared <em>"that

                                        the only God, and that Christ was not very (truly) God."</em> He was pronounced
                                    "an obstinate heretic"
                                    and was burnt in Smithfield.</p>

                                    (AKA Miguel Servet, Miguel de Villanueva, 1511 - 1553) was this day,
                                    burnt alive atop a pyre of his own books at the Plateau of Champel at the edge of
                                    Geneva.
                                    Servetus was a Spanish theologian, physician, cartographer, a polymath and the
                                    discoverer of pulmonary circulation.
                                    Regarding the Trinity, Servetus wrote the following books: <em>On the Errors of the
                                        Trinity, Dialogues on the Trinity and
                                        the Restitution of Christianity.</em>
                                    Servetus sought to dialogue with John Calvin.
                                    Calvin vowed that if Servetus was to ever visit Geneva,
                                    <em>"should he come, if my authority is of any avail, I will not suffer him
                                        to get out alive."</em><br>
                                    Thus, Servetus was burnt alive on the 27th of October, 1553. A strong breeze that
                                    sprung up
                                    scattered the flames and kept him in great torture for about half an hour. He was
                                    heard to exclaim,
                                    <em>Jesus, thou Son of the Eternal God, have pity on me.</em> So died this
                                    distinguished physician and reformer.
                                    <br>An eyewitness noted that if he had only moved the adjective "eternal"
                                    and called <br>Jesus the "Eternal Son of God," (i.e. a Trinitarian confession)
                                    his life would have been spared.<br>

                                    In a moment of weakness he signed the recantation, acknowledging the Trinity and
                                    kindred
                                    doctrines. As soon as he could escape from Geneva he did so. For some time he led a
                                    wandering life in Savoy, France, and Germany. He bitterly repented of his prior
                                    action
                                    and employed himself afterwards in spreading his Unitarian views. He was arrested as
                                    a heretic
                                    and sentenced to be beheaded <em>"for attacking the Trinity, and teaching that the

                                    him by the Senate
                                    if he would again renounce his religious views.<br><em>He firmly declined.</em>
                                    Just before he laid his head on the block, he said <em>"Many have suffered for the

                                        rel="noopener">John Sigismund Zapolya or Szapolyai</a>
                                    (Hungarian: Szapolyai Janos Zsigmond; 7 July 1540 - 14 March 1571)
                                    was King of Hungary as John II from 1540 to 1551
                                    and from 1556 to 1570, and the first Prince of Transylvania, from 1570 to his death.
                                    He initiated a series of theological debates among
                                    the representatives of the concurring theological schools of the Reformation in the
                                    1560s.
                                    He converted from Catholicism to Lutheranism in 1562 and from Lutheranism to
                                    Calvinism in 1564.
                                    Around 1567-1568, he accepted the anti-Trinitarian views of his physician, Giorgio
                                    Biandrata
                                    and court preacher Ferenc David, thus becoming <em>the only Unitarian monarch in
                                        history.</em>
                                    In 1568, was passed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Torda"
                                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Edict of Torda</a> (now Turda in Romania),
                                    which emphasised that <em>"faith is a gift of God" and prohibited the persecution of
                                        people
                                        for religious reasons.</em>
                                    In practice, the edict only sanctioned the existence of four "received"
                                    denominations -
                                    the Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist, and <em>Unitarian Churches.</em>
                                    Therefore, Sigismund's legacy is that religious tolerance remained
                                    a distinguishing feature of the Principality of Transylvania (historical region in
                                    Romania)
                                    in Early modern Europe.

                                    or Francis Davidis);
                                    was a Unitarian preacher and the founder of the Unitarian Church of Transylvania.
                                    In Latin and Hungarian he used his name as Francis Davidis or David Ferenc
                                    after his father's forename David.
                                    King John II called for three debates with Catholics, Lutherans, Calvinists
                                    and the new Antitrinitarians to discuss the Trinity.
                                    The first two debates were held at Gyualafhervat (Alba Iulia, Romania) in 1566 and
                                    1568,
                                    and the final one was at Nagyvarad (Oradia, Romania).
                                    Francis David, thereby, disputed the mainstream Christian doctrine of the Trinity,
                                    believing God to be one and indivisible.

                                    King John II had sided with the Antitrinitarians. Back in Kolozsvar (present-day

                                    David preached an exultant open-air sermon standing on a preaching stone (pictured).
                                    The stone is still housed today in the vestibule of the First Unitarian Church in
                                    Cluj.
                                    Later Unitarian historiography had it that this sermon led to
                                    the wholesale conversion of the city to Unitarianism.<br>
                                    Because of his influence and contribution, these words of Francis David

                                    burnt at the stake in Smithfield. He was described as "a man of high character,
                                    very conversant with the Bible and a fluent speaker." He opposed the Athanasian and
                                    Nicene creeds, and said that there was <em>but one person in the Godhead,
                                        not three; that Jesus Christ was not God, but the anointed of God.</em>
                                    For such teaching he had been cast into Newgate prison. He was convicted of heresy,
                                    and was handed over to the secular judges.<br>
                                    King James I, who was fond of theological discussion, had many interviews with him

                                    burnt at the stake in Lichfield.
                                    He was a Unitarian, pious, of exemplary life and conversation, and well versed
                                    in biblical lore.<br>
                                    He claimed that the doctrine of the Trinity was a total fabrication, stating that
                                    Christ was <em>only a man
                                        "and a mere Creature and not both God and man in one person ...

                                        perfect man without sin"</em>
                                    <br>Wightman was accused of sixteen distinct heresies and declared to be
                                    an obstinate and incorrigible heretic.
                                    <br><em>Edward Wightman was the last person in England to be burned at the stake

                                    After the restoration of Charles II an act was passed in 1677
                                    <em>"forbidding the burning of heretics."</em>
                                    The death penalty for heresy remained in Scotland,
                                    where the last person executed for blasphemy or heresy was

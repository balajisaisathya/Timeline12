            <p>The Bible speaks of one God and His human Son, Jesus the Christ.
                Within a century of Jesus' resurrection, he was already being referred to as God.
                The transformation was so quick that one writer titled his book,
                <em>"From Jewish Prophet to Gentile God."</em>
                <span>This timeline highlights key events of the transformation and individuals

                                <p>The Bible's New Testament references two primary individuals, as seen by a fresh

                                    Namely the One God, the Father; and His human Son, Jesus the Christ (the Messiah).

                            <h3>Jesus the Messiah</h3>
                            <div class="flex-display">

                                    During this era, Jesus of Nazareth, the Messiah, said in Mark 12:29,
                                    <em>"The first of all the commandments is Hear O Israel! The LORD (namely YAHWEH)
                                        our God, YAHWEH is one."</em> Jesus had quoted the Shema, that is, Deuteronomy 6:4.
                                    In prayer, Jesus said in John 17:3, <em>"You Father, are the Only True God."</em>
                                    In John 8:40, Jesus said of himself, "But now you seek to kill me, <em>a man</em>
                                    who has told you the truth which I heard from God."
                                    In John 20:17, after he was raised from the dead by God, Jesus proclaimed
                                    <em>"I am ascending to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God."</em>
                                    So it is clear that during this era, Jesus presents himself as <em>a man</em>,
                                    who prays to and is distinct from the God of the Jews.
                                    <span>Please note: the terms <em>The Messiah and The Christ</em> are
                                        synonymous.</span>

                                <p>Peter told a crowd of over 3000 people on the Day of Pentecost that Jesus of Nazareth
                                    is <em>a man</em> approved of God. (Acts 2:22)
                                    That God had resurrected Jesus from the dead and that Jesus was elevated to a
                                    position of lordship by God. (Acts 2:36)
                                    Despite this, Peter refers to Jesus as <em>"the Servant of God"</em> four times,
                                    emphasising a clear distinction between God and Jesus. (Acts 3:13,26; 4:27,30)

                                    The apostle Paul (AKA Saul of Tarsus) at his conversion confessed
                                    that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God. (Acts 9:20,22) Paul declared in 1 Timothy
                                    2:5 that
                                    <em>"There is one God and one Mediator between God and men, 'the Man' Christ
                                        Jesus."</em>
                                    To the Corinthians, Paul declared <em>"There is no other God but one. To us there is
                                        one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus
                                        Christ, through whom are all things, and through whom we live."</em>
                                    <br>(1 Corinthians 8:4,6)
                                    <span>So to Paul, as well as to his Christian audience, there is solely ONE GOD, the
                                        Father;
                                        whilst Jesus the Messiah, is the human mediator between the ONE GOD and
                                        humankind.</span>

                                <p>Tertullian is perhaps most famous for being the first writer in Latin known to use
                                    the term trinity (Latin: <em>trinitas</em>).
                                    This is his commentary on the majority of the believers in his era: "<em>The simple,
                                        indeed, (I will not call them unwise and unlearned,) who always constitute the
                                        majority of believers</em>, are startled at the dispensation (of the Three in
                                    One), on the ground that their very rule of faith withdraws them from the world's
                                    plurality of gods to the one only true God; ... The numerical order and distribution
                                    of the Trinity they assume to be a division of the Unity ... <em>They are constantly
                                        throwing out against us that we are preachers of two gods and three gods</em>,
                                    while they take to themselves pre-eminently the credit of being worshippers of the
                                    One God;"

                                <p>In a sermon about the Passover, Melito of Sardis promulgates deicide! 
                                    That is, he makes the following statement: "The one who
                                    hung the earth in space, is himself hanged; the one who fixed the heavens in place,
                                    is himself impaled; the one who firmly fixed all things, is himself firmly fixed to
                                    the tree. The Lord is insulted, <em>God has been murdered</em>, the King of Israel
                                    has been destroyed by the right hand of Israel."<span>In just under two centuries
                                        following the birth of Jesus, Jesus has been identified <em>as the God who was
                                            killed!</em> The departure from biblical teachings was quick and

                                <p>Photinus (died 376), was a Christian bishop of Sirmium in Pannonia Secunda (Pictured
                                    is a scale model of Sirmium; today, the town Sremska Mitrovica in Serbia).
                                    None of Photinus' writings exist today; his views are known, however, mostly through
                                    the twenty-seven anathemas of the council in 351 which condemned him.
                                    <span><em>Photinian</em> became a term to describe anyone who held Christ to be
                                        <em>a man,
                                            who did not exist until his birth at Nazareth.</em> (As taught in the

                                    the state church of the Roman Empire. It condemned other Christian creeds as
                                    heresies of
                                    <em>"foolish madmen,"</em> and authorised their punishment.
                                    It reads: "Let us believe in the one deity of the Father and of the Son
                                    and of the Holy Spirit, in equal majesty and in a holy Trinity.
                                    We order the followers of this law to embrace the name of Catholic Christians;
                                    but as for the others, since, in our judgment <em>they are foolish madmen</em>,
                                    we decree that they shall be branded with the ignominious name of <em>heretics</em>,
                                    and shall not presume to give to their conventicles the name of churches.
                                    They will suffer in the first place the chastisement of the divine condemnation
                                    and in the second <em>the punishment of our authority</em> which in accordance
                                    with the will of Heaven <em>we shall decide to inflict.</em>"</p>

                                    the Roman Emperor Theodosius I; the 'Holy Spirit' was added to the Nicene Creed.
                                    The Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed declared that "the Lord, the Giver of Life,
                                    Who proceeds from the Father, Who with the Father and the Son is worshipped and
                                    glorified."
                                    Thus finalising the doctrine of the Trinity as known throughout Christendom today.
                                    So, a doctrine and a creed, which are not mentioned in Scripture were foisted onto
                                    Christians, by the aid of the Roman Empire.

                                    II. It confirmed the
                                    original Nicene Creed and condemned the teachings of Nestorius, who held that Mary
                                    may be called <em>the Christotokos, "Christ-bearer" but not the Theotokos,
